# OOTD.AI
## Project Overview
**Objective:** To create an AI powered fashion advisor that provides personalized outfit recommendations based on user uploaded images, user preferences and style analysis.

**Problem Statement:** Many people struggle with picking outfits that suit their style, occasion, and personal preferences. OOTD.AI will simplify this by offering AI-driven outfit suggestions

## Features & Functionality

2. Fashion Style Quiz (Optional)
   - Short quiz to determine user style (casual, formal, streetwear, etc)
3. Virtual Closet Integration
   - Users can upload images based of their clothes and AI will suggest matching pieces
   - Users manually log their wardrobe items (e.g entering clothing details like color, type)
   - AI matches these logged items to create full outfits
   - Works without needing image recognition
4. Image-Based Outfit Analysis
   - Users can upload images of their clothes, and AI will suggest matching pieces
